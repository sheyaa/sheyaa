## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Yodd Mena and I'm an inspired data scientist from Los Angeles, CA, USA. ðŸŒµ

A little about myself:

I graduated from UCLA in 2020 with a Bachelorâ€™s in Applied Mathematics, driven by my love for puzzles and numbers. Early on, I knew I wanted to share this passion with others and initially saw education as my career path. My perspective shifted after taking several statistics courses, where I was introduced to statistical programming in R and MATLAB. I became fascinated by the ability to combine mathematics with technology to solve complex problems and create visualizations and therefore discovered an ideal career path that combined statistics, programming, and analytical skills. This realization led me to pursue further education, and I completed my Masterâ€™s in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics. My thesis focused on optimizing support vector machines to detect the precise moment a subject, specifically a mouse, became infected with salmonella.

My curiosity and passion for learning continue to drive me, and I am currently enhancing my skills through new projects.
